# kindbot

**VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: I developed this bot waaaaaay before Discord added lots of interesting functionality to interact with bots in a nicer way. I wouldn't use this if I were you, but I'm keeping it here anyway."

A Discord bot that automates a few things. Feel free to use it if any of the commands look useful.

<h2>Current Functionality</h2>
<h3>Race Fuel Calculator</h3>
<p>Based on the race length in minutes, the lap time in minutes:seconds.milliseconds, and the fuel consumption per lap, this command calculates the fuel you'll need for an entire race. Useful for simracing games like Assetto Corsa Competizione, and saves you having to visit a website to do the calculation.</p>
